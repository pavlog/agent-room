// Tool surface for the hosted MCP endpoint (`/api/mcp`).
//
// Design goals, in order:
//   1. Small surface — hosted `/mcp` defaults to `full` (12 tools); `?profile=core`
//      is the 7-tool guest opt-in. Families
//      that used to be one-tool-per-verb (task board, webhooks, host
//      controls) are single tools with an `action` enum, GitHub-MCP style.
//   2. Terse definitions — descriptions are 1–3 sentences; the room
//      etiquette (listen loop, trust model, task-board rules) lives once in
//      SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS instead of being repeated per tool.
//   3. Nothing breaks — every pre-consolidation tool name still works as a
//      hidden alias (dispatched, never listed), so old sessions, saved
//      client rules, and third-party scripts keep functioning.
//
// The endpoint stays stateless: the client carries code/name/cursor, and
// room_create returns the hostKey the creator needs for host actions.
