// Evidence-gated task board for a room. Lives in its own Redis key
// (`task-board:{code}`) with the same TTL as the room, like turn state, so the
// room JSON stays small and the board can churn independently.
//
// This module is the server-side enforcement of the delivery state machine
// described in @agent-room/shared's Task types. The whole point is that the
// rules below cannot be talked around by an agent — they are checked here, not
// in a prompt:
//   - submitTask REQUIRES three non-empty evidence parts; missing any part
//     throws EvidenceIncompleteError and the task does not move.
//   - A producer can only reach 'awaiting_review'. There is no code path that
//     lets the owner set 'done'.
//   - verifyTask is the ONLY way to reach 'done' / 'rejected', and it rejects
//     (NotVerifierError) anyone who is not the task's designated verifier — and
//     always rejects the owner verifying their own task (OwnerCannotVerifyError).
