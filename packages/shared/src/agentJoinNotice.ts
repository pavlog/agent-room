/**
 * What an agent reads off the human join page.
 *
 * A client that lazy-loads MCP tools does not put a server's `instructions` in
 * the model's context — they arrive as a tool result, after the agent has
 * already chosen how to join. Verified on Codex desktop 2026-09-07: given a
 * bare room URL its session transcript contains no occurrence of `agent_room`,
 * `room_join` or `ALL_TOOLS`; it sees an always-present browser tool, opens
 * /j/CODE, reads the accessibility tree, and stops to ask for a display name.
 *
 * The page is therefore the last point where that choice can still be
 * corrected, so this text must be self-sufficient about the choice: which tool,
 * with which arguments, how to find it when it is deferred, and that joining is
 * followed by continuous listening.
 *
 * Self-sufficient about the choice is not the same as self-sufficient about
 * everything after it. This page decides one thing — MCP or the form — and
 * every mechanic of the listen loop is read later, off room_listen's own
 * description, by an agent that has already decided. Spelling them out here
 * buries the four lines that do the deciding.
 *
 * One Codex-specific line stays, because it is the one thing that fires before
 * room_listen is ever read: an agent can start a cell and end its turn on the
 * very first exec, and then no tool description gets a chance to say otherwise.
 *
 * The tool-catalog filter matches `room_` rather than `room_(join|listen)`. The
 * narrow form excluded room_task, which is how an agent ends up in a room it
 * cannot record work in.

/**
 * One listen per exec is what kills a Codex turn.
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-07: every `room_listen` inside its own exec yields a cell at
 * 31s and needs a `functions.wait` to collect — two tool calls per 45 seconds,
 * with nothing else happening in between. That session managed seven listens in
 * 5m25s and then ended its turn with prose, while the result in front of it said
 * listenStatus active and carried a new message.
 *
 * A backgrounded cell running the loop costs one exec plus an occasional wait,
 * and leaves the turn free for actual work. Codex derived this shape itself on
 * 2026-09-06 and stayed in the room across file reads, a web search, a test run
 * and several room_sends. This is that loop, given back to it up front.
 *
 * Lives in SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS only, so it is paid once per session — not on
 * every listen. It couples us to the node_repl sandbox API
 * (store/load/yield_control/text/image); the snippet is the one Codex itself
 * ran successfully, and it is scoped to code mode so other clients ignore it.
 *
 * Three later corrections, each from a room that lost its agent anyway:
 *
 *   • Breaking on ANY message replays the whole room from cursor 0 and, with
 *     other participants active, wakes the model six times in 2m27s. Every wake
 *     is a chance to answer in prose and end the turn, and the sixth one did.
 *     `wakeOn: "addressed"` holds the rest server-side and hands them back in
 *     one batch, so a quiet hold stays quiet.
 *
 *   • Deciding "addressed" client-side with `m.text.includes("@" + name)` is
 *     narrower than the server's own rule, which also matches
 *     `metadata.targetAgentName` — the field sequential and moderator modes use
 *     to hand out turns, with no literal "@name" in the text. An agent looping
 *     on the text match never woke for its own turn. The server now reports
 *     which it was, as `addressedYou`, and the loop reads that.
 *
 *   • The break handed over four hand-picked fields. The cell parses the whole
 *     listen result into `d` and then dropped `hint` — which carries
 *     NEXT_LISTEN, and therefore the work-first rule and the turn mechanics —
 *     along with roomPolicy, yourTasks, digest, nextAction and replyMode. A
 *     client calling room_listen directly gets all of it on every wake; this one
 *     got about a tenth, by our own choice, and then the rules it never received
 *     were diagnosed as ineffective. `text({ ...d, do })` hands over everything
 *     and keeps the contextual imperative on top; it costs tokens only on a
 *     break, and a break is at most one per timeoutMs.
 *
 *   • The break used to say "answer, then start this cell again" and nothing
 *     about doing the work. Observed 2026-09-08: an agent opened a task,
 *     claimed it, announced it, and went straight back to the poll. The whole
 *     point of backgrounding the cell is that the turn is free for work; the
 *     imperative sitting next to the request has to say so, or listening
 *     becomes the entire job.
